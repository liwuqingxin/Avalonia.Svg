# Using

- About nuget: Not available now.

- Using Icon control and it's IconSvg Property.

```Xaml
<controls:Icon Width="24"
               Height="24"
               IconSvg="avares://Nlnet.Avalonia.Svg.Sample/Assets/bug-fill.svg" />
```

- Using Icon control and it's IconSvgData Property.

```Xaml
<controls:Icon ClipToBounds="{Binding #ClipToBounds.IsChecked}"
               IconStretch="Uniform"
               IconSvg="avares://Nlnet.Avalonia.Svg.Sample/Assets/NLNet.svg"
               IconSvgData="{Binding Path=EditableSvgData}"
               IsHitTestVisible="False"
               Opacity="{Binding #SvgGroundOpacity.Value}"
               ShowDiagnosis="{Binding #ShowDiagnosis.IsChecked}" />
```

# Features

:white_check_mark: The **Avalonia.Svg** library supports a variety of features for loading and rendering SVG files, including:

- Loading SVG files from a svg data, svg file or a stream.
- ~~Resolving external resources (such as images) referenced in the SVG file.~~
- Applying transformations (such as scaling, rotation, and translation) to the SVG image.
- Setting the fill and stroke colors of the SVG image.
- Clipping the SVG image to a specific area.

:pensive: While the `Avalonia.Svg` library supports a wide range of SVG features, there are some limitations to be aware of:

- The library does not support all SVG elements and attributes. In particular, some advanced features (such as filters and masks) are not currently supported.

- **Animation** and some other external feature of SVG are not supported, like resolving external resources (such as images) referenced in the SVG file.
- Performance may be impacted when rendering complex SVG files with a large number of elements or gradients. We have not made any performance optimization about it till now.

:date: **Pattern**, **masker** and **mark** are coming soon.
